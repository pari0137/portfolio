## Struggles I Had

I struggled a lot coding this portfolio. The  biggest struggle was  resizing the images to not be larger than the screen. Unfortunately, no matter 
what I tried, I could not get anything to work. Even if I simply tried to change the width. This is a major flaw on the site  as it takes away from 
any information.


## What I Learned

Creating this portfolio, I learned that you should always overestimate how much time you need to create something. I completely underestimated how 
much time it would take me to be able to complete this project and had to hand in something I wasn't happy with.

## Helpful Resources

One thing that I used during this project that saved me a lot of time was https://grid.layoutit.com/. As someone who struggled to 
wrap my mind around how to use grid properly, this was extremely helpful!
