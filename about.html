        <h2> Who Am I?</h2>
        
        <p> Hi, I'm Kam! I am  19 years old and am currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. I am looking to pursue a career in UX design or product design after I graduate, as well as have my own business where I can pursue my  passion for photography and social media management.</p>
        <p class="hobbies"> In my free time, I love to bake, read, play video games, hike, and spen time with my family and dogs.</p>
        

        
        <h3> Why I Do What I Do</h3>
        <p> Designing is my form of self-expression. My main goal when starting a new project is to make someone feel something, and to tell a story, whatever it may be. It's what drives me to create. In my photography session  and  social media management, I want to ccapture the client and who they are, wether it be their business or their family or even just them in their everyday life.</p>
